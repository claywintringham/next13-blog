This tutorial is from Dave Gray's YouTube channel, a great resource for anyone who wants to learn more about Next.js (13!). This project is quite advanced for me and somewhere in the middle of the tutorial I just started only coding along Dave Gray. I really need to brush up on some basic Next.js concepts to move forward. I'm still a bit lost as to which Next.js concepts I should be learning. I'm actually not sure what concepts I need to brush up on (whether it's React, or Node.js, especially with the fs Module and its methods like readFileSync(), readdirSync(), and packages like Gray Matter - I also got really lost on the part about the lib folder...). Hope I get that figured out soon!
